# Spam-Detection
In this data analysis project, a meticulous and systematic approach was taken to process and prepare the SMS spam dataset for classification. The data pre-processing stage was a critical first step, involving thorough cleansing and transformation of the raw SMS data to ensure its suitability for subsequent analysis.

To enhance the representation of the textual data and enable effective modeling, advanced featurization techniques were applied. Two powerful methods, namely Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer, were employed to convert the text messages into numerical feature vectors. Count Vectorizer counted the occurrences of each word in the messages, while TF-IDF Vectorizer weighed the importance of each word in relation to the entire dataset, taking into consideration its frequency across all messages. These techniques allowed for the creation of comprehensive and informative numerical representations of the textual data, laying the foundation for accurate classification.

The core of the project involved building a sophisticated grid classifier model. The grid classifier explored a wide range of hyperparameter combinations, optimizing its configuration to achieve the best possible classification results. This process involved training the model on different parameter settings and evaluating its performance on multiple validation sets to identify the most effective configuration.

The classification model's performance was rigorously assessed using test metrics, specifically the F1-score, which is a crucial indicator of a model's accuracy in handling imbalanced datasets like the SMS spam dataset. The F1-score is a balanced measure that takes into account both precision and recall, offering a comprehensive evaluation of the model's ability to correctly identify both spam and non-spam messages.

The results of the analysis were highly promising, with the grid classifier model achieving an impressive prediction test metric of 0.94 F1-score. This exceptional performance demonstrated the model's robustness and reliability in accurately classifying SMS messages as either spam or legitimate.

In conclusion, this project exemplifies a comprehensive and skillful data analysis process, encompassing data pre-processing, feature engineering through Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer, and the construction of an optimized grid classifier model. The outstanding prediction test metrics, particularly the remarkable 0.94 F1-score, confirm the effectiveness of the classification model in accurately identifying spam messages, providing valuable insights for spam detection and effective message filtering applications.
